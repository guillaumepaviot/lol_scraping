# lol_scraping

This is a small script to gather LOL data using Riot's API
For this, you'll need :
- a Riot's API key that you can find on their developper portal
- a Google service account to write directly on your Google sheet (you can also save it as a CSV file after the scraping)
- a list of players to scrape data from (with the columns : Name,Summoner,Puuid,Role,Team)
